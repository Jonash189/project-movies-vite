# Movie Site Project

This project involved building a responsive movie site using TMDB's API. It featured a homepage displaying a list of movies and a detail page for individual movies, accessed via React Router. The focus was on clean code, accessibility (95+ Lighthouse score), and dynamic API integration for movie data and images.



### The Problem

I struggled with styling, particularly for desktop layouts, as changes didn’t apply correctly. Eventually, I discovered the issue was a syntax error. Since styling consumed much of my time, I couldn’t structure the project as effectively as planned. The goal was to make the code more reusable by creating components like Homepage, ListPage, and a RouterPage to handle linking. If I had more time, I would have focused on structuring the project this way.
